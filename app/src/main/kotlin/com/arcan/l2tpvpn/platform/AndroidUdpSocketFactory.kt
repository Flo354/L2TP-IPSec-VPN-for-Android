/**
 * Opens the UDP sockets the IKE/ESP/L2TP stack talks to the concentrator through.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing:
 *
 *  * **`VpnService.protect(socket)`.** Without it the tunnel's own packets would be routed back
 *    into the TUN interface the moment it is established, and the connection would deadlock in a
 *    routing loop. Every socket this factory hands out is protected before it is used, and a
 *    refusal is treated as fatal rather than silently ignored.
 *  * **A real [UdpSocketChannel.localAddress].** The socket is bound to the wildcard address so
 *    the kernel can pick the source per destination, which means `socket.localAddress` is
 *    `0.0.0.0`. The IKE identity payload and both NAT-D hashes are computed over the local
 *    address, so a wildcard would make the peer's NAT detection nonsense. We therefore probe the
 *    routing table with a throwaway connected socket — a UDP `connect` sends nothing, it only
 *    resolves the route — and report the address of the interface that actually reaches the peer.
